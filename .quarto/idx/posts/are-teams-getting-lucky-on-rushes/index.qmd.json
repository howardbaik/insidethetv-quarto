For example, is the number of shots that were preceded by passes repeatable over an entire season? What about shooting percentages? If repeatable, do zones of the primary pass (the pass preceding a shot) influence this repeatability? What about rebounds and rebound shooting percentages (the goals scored from rebounds)?\n\n\n## Terminology\n\nIn hockey, \"odd-man rushes\" is a term frequently used to refer to offensive attacks such as the above where the attacking team has more players than the defending team. In my analysis, I will be slightly deviating from this jargon and instead use \"odd-player rushes\", which consist of shots that were preceded by passes and taken on breakaways, 2-on-1, 3-on-2, etc. Any shots that are not rush shots with a player advantage are categorized as `all_other_shots`.\n\nIn the later parts of this analysis, I will be using the terms, \"rebound shot\" and \"rebound shooting percentage\". The first indicates a shot on goal following a rebound and the second is calculated as rebound goals (goals that follow rebounds) divided by rebound shots.\n\n\n## Data\n\nTo investigate these questions, I will be using the Passing Project Data from the 2015~2018 NHL seasons organized by [Ryan Stimson](https://twitter.com/RK_Stimp) and [Corey Sznajder](https://twitter.com/ShutdownLine). The data was collected by a group of volunteers who tracked **every pass leading to a shot.** According to Ryan's [MIT Sloan Sports Analytics Conference paper](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1614.pdf), \"Each tracker was required to complete 2 - 3 training games for validation by the project leader to ensure consistency in classification of passes and recording of data. Occasional spot-checking of games was also conducted.\"\n\n\n```{r, warning = FALSE, include = FALSE}\n# Load

Some notable metrics that I will be using for my analysis include `shot_on_goal` (1 for yes and 0 for no), `goal` (1 for yes and 0 for no), `odd_man` (number of players involved in player advantages during rushes), `shooting_percentage` (number of goals / number of shots on goals), `shot_type` (one-timer, slap shot, wrist/snap shot, backhand, etc), `a1_zone` (zone that the primary assist originated), and `rebound_shot_on_goal` (if a rebound occured and resulted in a shot on goal). \n\nMany researchers have used this dataset to explore interesting research topics in hockey.  For example, [Ryan Stimson's paper](http://www.sloansportsconference.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/1614.pdf) discusses repeatability of certain metrics on a team level and player level. Among other analysis, [this NHL Numbers post](https://www.nhlnumbers.com/2016/08/10/passing-project-dangerous-primary-shot-contributions) covers repeatability of passes that crosses through the royal road (the line that goes directly through the middle of the ice from one net to the other) and provides visualizations. \n\nIn this analysis, I will look at repeatability of shots that were preceded by passes and taken during rushes with player advantages, shooting percentages, rebound shots, and rebound shooting percentages in **5v5 situations.**\n\n\n## Methods\n\nMy main analysis tools are **scatterplots** and **linear regression lines**. I use linear regression to examine the relationship between first-half statistics (x-axis on all plots below) and second-half statistics (y-axis on all plots below) within the same seasons at the team level. To do this, I split each of the 2015-16, 2016-17, and 2017-18 seasons into first-half (before Jan 1st) and second-half (after Jan 1st) and then calculated the quantities of interest at the team level within each half-season. I then matched up the team statistics from each half-season with its counterpart (e.g. Vancouver's 2016-17 first-half statistics with Vancouver's 2016-17 second-half statistics). \n\nI utilized [Hadley Wickham's](http://hadley.nz/) `ggplot2` package, a [\"system declaratively creating graphics, based on The Grammar of Graphics\"](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) to plot this information on a scatterplot and layered the regression line on each graph. I included 95% confidence bands, which provide a confidence interval on the slope of the regression line. In other words, we are 95% confident that the true regression line falls within the confidence bands, given the data we observed.\n\n* If I can draw a horizontal line completely within the confidence bands, this means there exists a regression line with a slope of 0 within the 95% confidence band. This indicates that there is **no significant relationship** between the x-variable and the y-variable.\n* If I **cannot** draw a horizontal line completely within the confidence bands, this means that a regression line with a slope of 0 falls outside the 95% confidence band. In other words, there is **a significant relationship** between the x-variable and the y-variable.\n\nIn each of the graphs below, there are three logos of each team, corresponding to each of the three seasons in the data. In terms of the linear regression graphs, the x-variable is a statistic from the first half of the season and the y-variable is a statistic from the second half of the season. As a result, we are really examining the relationship between the past and future of a statistic, or the _repeatability_ of a statistic.\n\n\n## Repeatability of Odd-Man Rush Shots\n\n```{r, include = FALSE, warning=FALSE}\npass_odd_man <- pass_final %>% \n  filter(strength == \"5v5\", !is.na(date)) %>%\n  # Further divide odd_man rushes by number of advantage in players\n  mutate(odd_man = ifelse(odd_man %in% c(\"1-0\", \"2-1\", \"3-2\", \"4-3\", \"2-0\", \"3-1\", \"4-2\", \"3-0\"), \n                          \"odd_man_rush\",\n                          \"all_other_shots\")) %>% \n  mutate(half = case_when(\n    season == \"first\" & game_id < 20571 ~ \"first\",\n    season == \"first\" & game_id >= 20571 ~ \"second\",\n    date >= as.Date(\"2016-10-01\") & date <= as.Date(\"2017-01-01\") ~ \"first\",\n    date > as.Date(\"2017-01-01\") & date < as.Date(\"2017-07-01\") ~ \"second\",\n    season == \"third\" & game_id < 20602~ \"first\",\n    season == \"third\" & game_id >= 20602~ \"second\"\n  )) %>%\n  filter(!is.na(half)) %>% \n  group_by(team, season, half, odd_man) %>%\n  # Get total number of shots/gp for each team, half, odd man situation\n  summarise(shots_per_game = n() / length(unique(date))) %>% \n  spread(key = half, value = shots_per_game, fill = 0) %>% \n  ungroup() %>% \n  filter(odd_man != \"NA\", team != \"NA\")\n```\n\n\n```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, echo = FALSE, warning = FALSE, message=FALSE}\n# Let's add on team logo urls to pass_odd_man\npass_odd_man <- pass_odd_man %>% \n  mutate(team_logo_url = match_logo(pass_odd_man))\n\n# From: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7549694/adding-regression-line-equation-and-r2-on-graph\n# Load function for annotating line of best fit and r-squared on plot\ndevtools::source_gist(\"524eade46135f6348140\", filename = \"ggplot_smooth_func.R\")\n\n\n# Plot\npass_odd_man %>%\n  filter(odd_man == \"odd_man_rush\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = first, y = second)) +\n  stat_smooth_func(geom=\"text\",method=\"lm\",hjust=0,parse=TRUE) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = season), size = 11) +\n  geom_image(aes(image = team_logo_url), size = 0.06) +\n  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = \"lm\") + \n  scale_color_discrete(name = \"Seasons\",\n                       breaks = c(\"first\", \"second\", \"third\"),\n                       labels = c(\"2015-2016\", \"2016-2017\", \"2017-2018\")) +\n  theme(text=element_text(family=\"Times\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Shots per GP in First Half \",\n       y = \"Shots per GP in Second Half\",\n       caption = \"Sources of Data:\\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/80aqppj7pm8xy17/AAA7yFpQVb74btfvLwjUd8oSa?dl=0\\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/yhhpwk2455nhyvp/Passing_Data_Master_11_11.xlsx?dl=0\\nhttps://www.patreon.com/CSznajder/overview\\n@howard_baik\"\n       ) +\n  ggtitle(\"Repeatability of Shots per GP For Odd Man Rushes\") \n```\n\n\n```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, echo = FALSE}\n# Plot\npass_odd_man %>%\n  filter(odd_man == \"all_other_shots\") %>% \n  ggplot(aes(x = first, y = second)) +\n  stat_smooth_func(geom=\"text\",method=\"lm\",hjust=0,parse=TRUE) +\n  geom_point(aes(color = season), size = 11) +\n  geom_image(aes(image = team_logo_url), size = 0.06) +\n  geom_smooth(formula = y ~ x, method = \"lm\") + \n  scale_color_discrete(name = \"Seasons\",\n                       breaks = c(\"first\", \"second\", \"third\"),\n                       labels = c(\"2015-2016\", \"2016-2017\", \"2017-2018\")) +\n  theme(text=element_text(family=\"Times\")) +\n  labs(x = \"Shots per GP in First Half \",\n       y = \"Shots per GP in Second Half\",\n       caption = \"Sources of Data:\\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/sh/80aqppj7pm8xy17/AAA7yFpQVb74btfvLwjUd8oSa?dl=0\\nhttps://www.dropbox.com/s/yhhpwk2455nhyvp/Passing_Data_Master_11_11.xlsx?dl=0\\nhttps://www.patreon.com/CSznajder/overview\\n@howard_baik\"\n       ) +\n  ggtitle(\"Repeatability of Shots per GP For All Other Shots\") \n```\n\n* Shots that were preceded by passes and taken on odd player rushes are not repeatable over a season; this signifies that **the number of odd-player rush shots per game in the first half is not a good predictor of the number of odd-player rush shots per game in the second half.**\n* However, all other shots that were preceded by passes are repeatable, meaning that **the number of shots per game in the first half is a good predictor of the number of shots per game in the second half.**\n\n> These findings suggest that hockey management and coaches must not read too much into the (lack of) offensive opportunities during odd player rushes in the first half; the second half presents a whole new playing field for players when it comes to odd player rushes.\n\n\n## Repeatability of Shooting Percentage\n\n_The below analysis on shooting percentages is parallel to the argument presented by Adam Gretz in [\"The roller coaster world of NHL shooting percentages\"](https://www.cbssports.com/nhl/news/the-roller-coaster-world-of-nhl-shooting-percentages/).

Using 2009-2010, 2010-2011, 2011-2012, and 2012-2013 data, he suggests that \"past rebound rates are not strongly predictive of future rates though they are consistent within a given season.\" The above graph illustrates that rebound rates are not \"consistent within a given season\".\n\n\n## Repeatability of Rebound Shooting Percentage\n\n\n```{r, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 7, echo = FALSE}\npass_final %>% \n  filter(strength == \"5v5\") %>%\n  filter(!is.na(date)) %>% \n  #

Furthermore, rebound shooting percentages (rebound goals _(goals scored from rebounds)_ divided by rebound shots) are not repeatable.\n\n\n\n## Conclusion\n\nHockey is an unpredictable sport. This signifies that a team that may have a horrible record before January 1st still can bounce back to become one of the league's best teams. Just ask the [2018 Arizona Coyotes](https://www.azcentral.com/story/sports/nhl/coyotes/2018/04/08/tale-two-seasons-how-coyotes-turned-around-second-half/497308002/). On Dec 31st, the Coyotes were 9-26-5 and were last in the league. \"But since Feb. 8, only four NHL teams had more points than Arizona over than span.\" The conclusion drawn from this analysis of different offensive statistics helps explain the resurgence of the Arizona Coyotes in the second half. \n\nI would like to thank Sam Ventura for his valuable advice.\n\n[Code](https://github.com/howardbaek/insidethetv-code/blob/master/are-teams-getting-lucky-nhl.Rmd)\n\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":true,"echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"knitr"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["../../styles.css"],"output-file":"index.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.245","editor":"visual","theme":"litera","title-block-banner":true,"comments":{"utterances":{"repo":"howardbaek/blog-comments"}},"title":"Are Teams getting Lucky on Rushes?","description":"When you watch an offensive rush in hockey, do you ever wonder about the numbers behind it?","author":"Howard Baek","date":"2018-06-28","categories":["Data Analysis"],"image":"thumbnail.jpg"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}

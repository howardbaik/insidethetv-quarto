Also, I am a Contractor at Merck, where I design internal R packages and a Shiny app for analysis and reporting process in a regulatory environment. Recently, I worked as a Biostatistics Intern at Merck, where I created an R package for querying ClinicalTrials.gov and building an analysis dataset (focus on oncology clinical trials) and programmed an accompanying Shiny app.\n\nMy past experiences include a [Machine Learning Internship](https://github.com/howardbaek/Upwelling-Image-Analysis) at Northwest Fisheries Science Center (NWFSC), where I created an algorithm to detect an oceanographic process, [NIH Research Assistantship](https://github.com/howardbaek/addiction-dashboard-simple) at the Behavioral Research In Technology and Engineering (BRiTE) Center, where I developed a Shiny Dashboard that allows patients and clinicians in addiction treatment to monitor patients’ progress and goals over time, and an [Educational Data Mining Research Internship](https://github.com/howardbaek/mooc-project-github) at George Mason University, where I analyzed real world datasets of an online course at Stanford.\n\n"},"formats":{"html":{"execute":{"fig-width":7,"fig-height":5,"fig-format":"retina","fig-dpi":96,"df-print":"default","error":false,"eval":true,"cache":null,"freeze":"auto","echo":true,"output":true,"warning":true,"include":true,"keep-md":false,"keep-ipynb":false,"ipynb":null,"enabled":null,"daemon":null,"daemon-restart":false,"debug":false,"ipynb-filters":[],"engine":"markdown"},"render":{"keep-tex":false,"keep-source":false,"keep-hidden":false,"prefer-html":false,"output-divs":true,"output-ext":"html","fig-align":"default","fig-pos":null,"fig-env":null,"code-fold":"none","code-overflow":"scroll","code-link":false,"code-line-numbers":false,"code-tools":false,"tbl-colwidths":"auto","merge-includes":true,"latex-auto-mk":true,"latex-auto-install":true,"latex-clean":true,"latex-max-runs":10,"latex-makeindex":"makeindex","latex-makeindex-opts":[],"latex-tlmgr-opts":[],"latex-input-paths":[],"latex-output-dir":null,"link-external-icon":false,"link-external-newwindow":false,"self-contained-math":false,"format-resources":[]},"pandoc":{"standalone":true,"wrap":"none","default-image-extension":"png","to":"html","css":["styles.css"],"output-file":"about.html"},"language":{},"metadata":{"lang":"en","fig-responsive":true,"quarto-version":"1.2.245","editor":"visual","theme":"litera","title":"About Me"},"extensions":{"book":{"multiFile":true}}}}}
